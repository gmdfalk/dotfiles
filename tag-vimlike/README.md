Configuration files for plugins/addons/extensions that add vim functionality to applications.

  * [pentadactylrc](pentadactylrc): [Pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/) for Firefox. Imo the best vim emulation for Web browsing if you need a cross platform browser.
  * [vimperatorrc](vimperatorrc): [Vimperator](http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator) for Firefox. More stable but fewer features than Pentadactyl.
  * [cvimrc](cvimrc): [cVim](https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim) for Chrome. As Chrome limits customizability of its UI cVim can't supply the same features and vim experience as pentadactyl/vimperator which is why i still prefer Firefox for Browsing.
  * [ideavimrc](ideavimrc): [ideavim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim) for [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/). It's amazing.
